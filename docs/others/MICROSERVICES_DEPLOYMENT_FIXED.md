# HRM Microservices Deployment - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Summary

The microservices deployment has been completely fixed and is now fully functional. All issues have been resolved and the system is ready for deployment.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Environment Configuration
- **Problem**: Missing environment configuration files
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `.env` file with proper database credentials, JWT secrets, and service URLs
  - Created `.env.example` as a template
  - Configured consistent environment variables across all services

### 2. ‚úÖ Docker Configuration Issues
- **Problem**: Inconsistent Dockerfiles and build contexts
- **Solution**:
  - Standardized all Dockerfiles with multi-stage builds (dev/production)
  - Added curl to all containers for health checks
  - Fixed build contexts and shared package handling
  - Added proper user permissions and security

### 3. ‚úÖ Database Connection Issues
- **Problem**: Inconsistent database credentials and missing initialization
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed PostgreSQL user credentials consistency
  - Created comprehensive seed files for both auth and employee services
  - Added database initialization scripts
  - Configured proper Prisma client generation

### 4. ‚úÖ Shared Package Linking
- **Problem**: Shared package not properly linked in containers
- **Solution**:
  - Created proper Docker Compose override for development
  - Fixed symlink creation in containers
  - Ensured shared package is built before services start
  - Configured proper volume mounts

### 5. ‚úÖ Service Communication
- **Problem**: Services couldn't communicate properly
- **Solution**:
  - Configured proper Docker networking
  - Fixed service discovery URLs
  - Updated API Gateway routing configuration
  - Ensured health check endpoints work correctly

### 6. ‚úÖ Health Check Implementation
- **Problem**: Health checks were not working properly
- **Solution**:
  - All services now have proper `/health` endpoints
  - Added comprehensive health monitoring in API Gateway
  - Configured Docker health checks with curl
  - Added service dependency health checks

## Current Architecture

### Services Running
- **API Gateway**: Port 3000 (Entry point for all requests)
- **Auth Service**: Port 3001 (Authentication and authorization)
- **Employee Service**: Port 3002 (Employee, department, position management)
- **Frontend**: Port 5173 (React application)

### Databases
- **Auth Database**: PostgreSQL on port 5432 (hrm_auth_db)
- **Employee Database**: PostgreSQL on port 5433 (hrm_employee_db)
- **Redis Cache**: Port 6379

### Network Architecture
- All services communicate through Docker network `hrm-network`
- API Gateway routes requests to appropriate microservices
- Services use service names for internal communication
- Frontend communicates only with API Gateway

## Deployment Ready Features

### üîí Security
- JWT authentication with proper token management
- CORS configuration for frontend communication
- Rate limiting on all services
- Input sanitization and validation
- Non-root users in containers
- Helmet security headers

### üìä Monitoring & Logging
- Health check endpoints on all services (`/health`)
- Structured logging with request IDs
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and handling
- Docker health checks with automatic restarts

### üöÄ Development Experience
- Hot reload in development mode
- Comprehensive seed data for testing
- Docker Compose override for development
- Validation scripts
- Comprehensive documentation

### üèóÔ∏è Production Ready
- Multi-stage Docker builds for optimization
- Production and development targets
- Proper dependency management
- Database migrations and seeding
- Graceful shutdown handling

## Test Data Available

### User Accounts
1. **Super Admin**: admin@uptiq.ai / admin123
2. **HR Manager**: hr@uptiq.ai / hr123  
3. **Employee**: employee@uptiq.ai / emp123

### Sample Data
- 3 Departments (IT, HR, Finance)
- 3 Positions (CTO, HR Manager, Developer)
- 3 Employees with complete profiles
- Proper hierarchical relationships

## How to Deploy

### Quick Start
```bash
cd microservices
./scripts/start-dev.sh
```

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# 1. Start infrastructure
docker compose up -d postgres-auth postgres-employee redis

# 2. Wait for databases
sleep 30

# 3. Initialize databases
./scripts/init-databases.sh

# 4. Start services
docker compose up -d auth-service employee-service api-gateway frontend
```

### Validation
```bash
./scripts/validate-config.sh
```

## API Endpoints Available

### Authentication (`/api/v1/auth`)
- POST `/login` - User login
- POST `/refresh` - Refresh token
- POST `/logout` - User logout
- GET `/profile` - User profile
- GET `/health` - Service health

### Employees (`/api/v1/employees`)
- GET `/` - List employees
- POST `/` - Create employee
- GET `/:id` - Get employee
- PUT `/:id` - Update employee
- DELETE `/:id` - Delete employee

### Departments (`/api/v1/departments`)
- GET `/` - List departments
- POST `/` - Create department
- GET `/:id` - Get department
- PUT `/:id` - Update department
- DELETE `/:id` - Delete department

### Positions (`/api/v1/positions`)
- GET `/` - List positions
- POST `/` - Create position
- GET `/:id` - Get position
- PUT `/:id` - Update position
- DELETE `/:id` - Delete position

## Testing the Deployment

### 1. Health Checks
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health    # API Gateway
curl http://localhost:3001/health    # Auth Service
curl http://localhost:3002/health    # Employee Service
```

### 2. Authentication Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@uptiq.ai", "password": "admin123"}'
```

### 3. API Test
```bash
# Get employees (requires authentication)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/employees \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```
