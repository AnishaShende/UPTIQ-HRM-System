# Swagger API Documentation Update

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive Swagger documentation updates made to the Employee and Authentication APIs to match the quality and standards of the existing Leave, Payroll, and Recruitment APIs.

## Changes Made

### 1. Employee API Documentation (`/admin/employees`)

#### Endpoints Documented:
- **POST /admin/employees** - Create a new employee
- **GET /admin/employees** - Get all employees with filtering and pagination
- **GET /admin/employees/search** - Search employees by name, email, or employee ID
- **GET /admin/employees/stats** - Get employee statistics
- **GET /admin/employees/{id}** - Get employee by ID
- **PUT /admin/employees/{id}** - Update employee information
- **DELETE /admin/employees/{id}** - Delete employee (soft delete)

#### Schemas Added:
- **Employee** - Complete employee object with all fields
- **CreateEmployeeRequest** - Request schema for creating employees
- **UpdateEmployeeRequest** - Request schema for updating employees
- **EmployeeSearchResult** - Response schema for search results

#### Features:
- Comprehensive request/response examples
- Detailed parameter documentation with validation rules
- Proper error response codes (400, 401, 404, 409, 500)
- Pagination support with query parameters
- Advanced filtering options (department, position, status, employment type, etc.)
- Search functionality
- Employee statistics endpoint

### 2. Authentication API Documentation (`/auth`)

#### Endpoints Documented:
- **POST /auth/register** - Register a new user account
- **POST /auth/login** - Authenticate user and get access tokens
- **POST /auth/refresh** - Refresh access token using refresh token
- **POST /auth/logout** - Logout user and invalidate refresh token
- **GET /auth/me** - Get current authenticated user profile

#### Schemas Added:
- **User** - Complete user object with employee relationship
- **AuthTokens** - JWT token pair (access + refresh)
- **LoginRequest/Response** - Login credential and response schemas
- **RegisterRequest/Response** - Registration schemas
- **RefreshTokenRequest/Response** - Token refresh schemas

#### Features:
- Detailed authentication flow documentation
- JWT token handling with proper security schemes
- User role system documentation
- Employee relationship mapping
- Security headers and error handling
- Token expiration information

## Key Improvements

### 1. Consistency with Existing APIs
- **OpenAPI 3.0 format** - Matches the standard used in leave/payroll/recruitment APIs
- **Tag organization** - "Employee Management" and "Authentication" tags
- **Response structure** - Consistent `{success, message, data}` format
- **Error handling** - Standardized error responses with proper HTTP codes
- **Security schemes** - Bearer token authentication properly documented

### 2. Comprehensive Schema Definitions
- **Field-level validation** - Min/max lengths, patterns, enums
- **Required vs optional fields** - Clearly marked
- **Data types** - Proper typing for dates, numbers, booleans
- **Relationships** - Employee-Department-Position-Manager relationships
- **JSON fields** - Personal info and bank info properly documented

### 3. Advanced Features
- **Pagination** - Consistent with other APIs
- **Filtering** - Multiple filter options for employees
- **Search** - Flexible search across multiple fields
- **Statistics** - Employee count and department distribution
- **Soft delete** - Proper handling of employee deactivation

### 4. Real-world Examples
- **Request examples** - Realistic data samples
- **Response examples** - Complete response structures
- **Validation examples** - Error response formats
- **Authentication flow** - Complete JWT workflow

## Route Configuration Updates

### Base URL Structure
```
/api/v1/auth/*              - Authentication endpoints
/api/v1/admin/employees/*   - Employee management endpoints
/api/v1/admin/leaves/*      - Leave management endpoints
/api/v1/admin/payroll/*     - Payroll management endpoints
/api/v1/admin/recruitment/* - Recruitment management endpoints
```

### Route Order Optimization
- Specific routes (search, stats) placed before parameterized routes
- Prevents route conflicts and ensures proper matching

## Data Models Consistency

### Employee Model
Based on Prisma schema, including:
- Personal information (name, email, phone, DOB)
- Employment details (hire date, department, position, manager)
- Financial information (salary, currency, grade)
- Status tracking (active/inactive, termination date)
- JSON fields for flexible data (personal info, bank details)

### User Model
Based on authentication requirements:
- Account details (email, role, active status)
- Security features (password handling, token management)
- Employee relationship (linked to employee record)
- Audit fields (login tracking, timestamps)

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Token expiration and refresh mechanism

### Input Validation
- Schema-based validation for all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention through Prisma ORM
- Input sanitization middleware

### Error Handling
- Consistent error response format
- No sensitive information leakage
- Proper HTTP status codes

## Testing and Validation

The updated documentation has been tested with:
- ✅ Server startup without errors
- ✅ Swagger UI loading successfully
- ✅ Schema validation
- ✅ Route mounting and ordering
- ✅ Consistent response structures

## API Documentation Access

The complete API documentation is available at:
- **Development**: http://localhost:3001/api-docs
- **Production**: https://api.hrm.uptiq.ai/api-docs

## Conclusion

The Employee and Authentication APIs now have comprehensive Swagger documentation that:
1. Matches the quality and detail level of existing APIs
2. Provides clear, actionable documentation for frontend developers
3. Includes proper validation and error handling
4. Supports advanced features like pagination, filtering, and search
5. Maintains consistency across the entire API ecosystem

This documentation will significantly improve the developer experience and reduce integration time for both internal and external API consumers.
