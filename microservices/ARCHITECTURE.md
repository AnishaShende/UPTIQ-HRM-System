# HRM Microservices Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the complete microservices architecture for the Human Resource Management (HRM) system, converted from a monolithic application.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
Each microservice is organized around business capabilities:
- **Auth Service**: User authentication and authorization
- **Employee Service**: Employee data and organizational structure
- **Leave Service**: Leave management and approvals
- **Payroll Service**: Salary processing and payslips
- **Recruitment Service**: Job postings and candidate management

### 2. Database Per Service
Each microservice has its own dedicated database to ensure:
- Data isolation and independence
- Technology diversity (can use different DB types)
- Independent scaling
- Failure isolation

### 3. API Gateway Pattern
Single entry point that provides:
- Request routing
- Authentication/authorization
- Rate limiting
- Load balancing
- Request/response transformation
- Monitoring and logging

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture
Services communicate through:
- Synchronous HTTP calls for immediate responses
- Asynchronous events for loose coupling
- Message queues for reliable delivery

## Service Decomposition Strategy

### Original Monolith Structure
```
backend/
├── controllers/
│   ├── auth.controller.ts
│   └── employee.controller.ts
├── services/
│   ├── auth.service.ts
│   ├── employee.service.ts
│   ├── department.service.ts
│   ├── position.service.ts
│   └── database.service.ts
├── routes/
│   ├── auth.routes.ts
│   └── employee.routes.ts
└── prisma/
    └── schema.prisma (single database)
```

### Microservices Structure
```
microservices/
├── shared/                 # Common utilities and types
├── api-gateway/           # Single entry point
├── auth-service/          # Authentication & authorization
├── employee-service/      # Employee, department, position data
├── leave-service/         # Leave management
├── payroll-service/       # Payroll processing
└── recruitment-service/   # Job postings and applications
```

## Data Architecture

### Database Segregation

#### Auth Service Database (hrm_auth_db)
```sql
Tables:
- users (authentication data)
- refresh_tokens
- login_history
```

#### Employee Service Database (hrm_employee_db)
```sql
Tables:
- employees (employee data)
- departments
- positions
```

#### Leave Service Database (hrm_leave_db)
```sql
Tables:
- leave_types
- leave_balances
- leave_requests
- leave_comments
```

#### Payroll Service Database (hrm_payroll_db)
```sql
Tables:
- salary_structures
- salary_components
- employee_salaries
- payroll_periods
- payslips
```

#### Recruitment Service Database (hrm_recruitment_db)
```sql
Tables:
- job_postings
- applicants
- job_applications
- interviews
- interviewer_assignments
```

### Data Consistency Strategies

1. **Eventual Consistency**: For non-critical operations
2. **Saga Pattern**: For distributed transactions
3. **Event Sourcing**: For audit trails
4. **CQRS**: For read/write separation where needed

## Communication Patterns

### 1. Synchronous Communication (HTTP/REST)
- Client to API Gateway
- API Gateway to Services
- Service-to-Service for immediate data needs

### 2. Asynchronous Communication (Events)
- User created → Employee service needs user info
- Employee updated → Payroll service needs updated data
- Leave approved → Employee service updates leave balance

### 3. Data Synchronization
Services maintain local copies of essential data from other services:
- Employee service stores user IDs from auth service
- Leave service stores employee references
- Payroll service stores employee references

## Security Architecture

### 1. Authentication Flow
```
Client → API Gateway → Auth Service
                  ↓
              JWT Token
                  ↓
Client → API Gateway → Service (with user context)
```

### 2. Authorization Levels
- **Service-to-Service**: Internal API keys
- **User Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Role-Based Access**: User roles (ADMIN, HR_MANAGER, EMPLOYEE, etc.)

### 3. Security Measures
- JWT tokens with short expiration
- Refresh token rotation
- Rate limiting per service
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS protection
- Helmet security headers

## Scalability Considerations

### 1. Horizontal Scaling
Each service can be scaled independently based on load:
```yaml
services:
  employee-service:
    deploy:
      replicas: 3  # Scale based on demand
  
  auth-service:
    deploy:
      replicas: 2  # Less frequent access
```

### 2. Database Scaling
- Read replicas for heavy read operations
- Connection pooling
- Database sharding if needed

### 3. Caching Strategy
- Redis for session management
- Application-level caching for frequently accessed data
- CDN for static assets

## Monitoring and Observability

### 1. Health Checks
Each service exposes health endpoints:
- `/health` - Basic health check
- `/health/detailed` - Detailed health with dependencies

### 2. Logging Strategy
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Centralized log aggregation
- Log levels: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG

### 3. Metrics Collection
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Custom metrics per service

### 4. Distributed Tracing
- Request tracing across services
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking

## Deployment Architecture

### 1. Containerization
Each service is containerized with:
- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Health checks
- Non-root user execution
- Minimal base images (Alpine Linux)

### 2. Orchestration
Docker Compose for development:
- Service dependencies
- Network isolation
- Volume management
- Environment configuration

### 3. Production Deployment
Kubernetes for production:
- Auto-scaling
- Load balancing
- Service discovery
- Rolling updates

## API Design Standards

### 1. REST Principles
- Resource-based URLs
- HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500)
- JSON request/response format

### 2. API Versioning
- Version in URL path: `/api/v1/`
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Deprecation notices for old versions

### 3. Error Handling
Consistent error response format:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "Error description",
    "statusCode": 400,
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

### 4. Response Format
Consistent success response format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 10,
    "total": 100
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- Individual service components
- Business logic validation
- Mock external dependencies

### 2. Integration Tests
- Service-to-service communication
- Database operations
- API endpoint testing

### 3. Contract Tests
- API contract validation
- Service interface compatibility
- Consumer-driven contracts

### 4. End-to-End Tests
- Complete user workflows
- Cross-service functionality
- UI integration tests

## Migration Strategy

### 1. Strangler Fig Pattern
Gradual migration approach:
1. Route specific endpoints to new services
2. Migrate data incrementally
3. Deprecate old monolith endpoints
4. Complete cutover when ready

### 2. Data Migration
- Extract service-specific data
- Maintain referential integrity
- Implement data synchronization
- Validate data consistency

### 3. Rollback Strategy
- Feature flags for quick rollback
- Database migration rollback scripts
- Service version management
- Blue-green deployment for zero downtime

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Network Latency
- Service colocation
- Connection pooling
- HTTP/2 for multiplexing
- Compression for large payloads

### 2. Database Performance
- Proper indexing
- Query optimization
- Connection pooling
- Read replicas for scaling

### 3. Caching Strategy
- Application-level caching
- Database query caching
- CDN for static content
- Cache invalidation strategies

## Disaster Recovery

### 1. Backup Strategy
- Automated database backups
- Cross-region replication
- Point-in-time recovery
- Configuration backups

### 2. High Availability
- Multi-instance deployment
- Load balancing
- Circuit breakers
- Graceful degradation

### 3. Recovery Procedures
- Service restart procedures
- Data recovery processes
- Rollback procedures
- Communication protocols

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Patterns
- Event Sourcing for audit trails
- CQRS for read/write optimization
- GraphQL for flexible queries
- gRPC for internal communication

### 2. Cloud Native Features
- Service mesh (Istio)
- Serverless functions
- Managed databases
- Auto-scaling policies

### 3. AI/ML Integration
- Predictive analytics
- Automated decision making
- Natural language processing
- Machine learning pipelines

This architecture provides a solid foundation for a scalable, maintainable, and resilient HRM system while maintaining all the functionality of the original monolith.
